[[geo-queries]]
== Geo queries

Elasticsearch supports two types of geo data:
<<geo-point,`geo_point`>> fields which support lat/lon pairs, and
<<geo-shape,`geo_shape`>> fields, which support points,
lines, circles, polygons, multi-polygons etc.

The queries in this group are:

<<query-dsl-geo-shape-query,`geo_shape`>> query::

    Find document with geo-shapes which either intersect, are contained by, or
    do not intersect with the specified geo-shape.

<<query-dsl-geo-bounding-box-query,`geo_bounding_box`>> query::

    Finds documents with geo-points that fall into the specified rectangle.

<<query-dsl-geo-distance-query,`geo_distance`>> query::

    Finds document with geo-points within the specified distance of a central
    point.

<<query-dsl-geo-distance-range-query,`geo_distance_range`>> query::

    Like the `geo_point` query, but the range starts at a specified distance
    from the central point.

<<query-dsl-geo-polygon-query,`geo_polygon`>> query::

    Find documents with geo-points within the specified polygon.

<<query-dsl-geohash-cell-query,`geohash_cell`>> query::

    Find geo-points whose geohash intersects with the geohash of the specified
    point.

.Percolating geo-queries in Elasticsearch 2.2.0 or later
[IMPORTANT]
======================================

The new <<geo-point,`geo_point` fields>> added in Elasticsearch 2.2.0 and
above require that <<doc-values,`doc_values`>> are enabled in order to
function. Unfortunately, the in-memory index used by the percolator does not
yet have support for `doc_values`, meaning that <<geo-queries,geo-queries>>
will not work in a percolator index created in Elasticsearch 2.2.0 or later.

See <<geo-percolate>> for a workaround.
