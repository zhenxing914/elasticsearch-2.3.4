== Transform

deprecated[2.0.0]

The document can be transformed before it is indexed by registering a script in
the `transform` element of the mapping. The result of the transform is indexed
but the original source is stored in the `_source` field.

This was deprecated in 2.0.0 because it made debugging very difficult. As of
now there really isn't a feature to use in its place other than transforming
the document in the client application.

Deprecated or no, here is an example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "example" : {
        "transform" : {
            "script" : {
                "inline": "if (ctx._source['title']?.startsWith('t')) ctx._source['suggest'] = ctx._source['content']",
                "params" : {
                    "variable" : "not used but an example anyway"
                },
                "lang": "groovy"
            }
        },
        "properties": {
           "title": { "type": "string" },
           "content": { "type": "string" },
           "suggest": { "type": "string" }
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

Its also possible to specify multiple transforms:
[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "example" : {
        "transform" : [
            {"script": "ctx._source['suggest'] = ctx._source['content']"},
            {"script": "ctx._source['foo'] = ctx._source['bar'];"}
        ]
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

Because the result isn't stored in the source it can't normally be fetched by
source filtering.  It can be highlighted if it is marked as stored.

=== Get Transformed
The get endpoint will retransform the source if the `_source_transform`
parameter is set.  Example:
[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -XGET "http://localhost:9200/test/example/3?pretty&_source_transform"
--------------------------------------------------

The transform is performed before any source filtering but it is mostly
designed to make it easy to see what was passed to the index for debugging.

=== Immutable Transformation
Once configured the transform script cannot be modified.  This is not
because that is technically impossible but instead because madness lies
down that road.
